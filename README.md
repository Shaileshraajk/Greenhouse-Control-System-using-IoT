# Greenhouse-Control-System-using-IoT
Greenhouse system to monitor the environmental parameters and support plant growth in an efficient manner with help of actuators.

Automation of greenhouses has been extremely helpful in maximizing crop yields and minimizing labour costs. The optimum conditions for cultivating plants are regularly maintained by the use of programmed sensors and actuators with constant monitoring of the system. In this project, we have designed a prototype of a smart greenhouse using Arduino microcontroller.

In this new modern world, with awareness of fitness and nutrition spreading, it is very essential that a variety of fruits and vegetables is available throughout the year, however the northern climate prevents the growth of certain vegetables and fruits during the winter. This leads to the importing of these essentials from southern countries which has some drawbacks.

Most importantly growing food means thereâ€™s not a lot of chemicals added, so the fruits or vegetables are rich in nutrition
The purpose of this project was therefore to make it easier to grow food at home. This can be achieved with the use of an automated greenhouse. A greenhouse makes it possible to replicate a different climate and consequently grow food that would not typically grow in the area.
